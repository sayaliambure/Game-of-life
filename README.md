# Game-of-life

* Conway's Game of Life, is a single-player logic game and cellular automaton
* each of which can be either alive (black) or dead (white)
* The game's evolution is determined by its initial state, so the player only creates an initial configuration and observes how it evolves

## The rules of the game are:
1. Births - A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive in the next generation
2. Death by isolation - A live cell with one or fewer live neighbors dies in the next generation
3. Death by overcrowding - A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies in the next generation
4. No change - A live cell with two or three live neighbors remains unchanged in the next generation
